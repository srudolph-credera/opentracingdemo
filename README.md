OpenTracing Demonstration
======
This project is composed of multiple simple services setup to use Zipkin via the OpenTracing standard. The services are composed to provide interesting traces.

The demo site allows the user to navigate the final image created by Reddit's [r/place experiment](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/). The activity heat map will be filled in as the user moves a mouse over the image. The user may also move two markers to plot a cross section of the heatmap data. These activities will result in a large number of traces that can be inspected.

NOTICE: All development has moved to [Credera/opentracingdemo](https://github.com/Credera/opentracingdemo)
